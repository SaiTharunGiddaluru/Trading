        Attention
        investors:  Stock brokers can accept securities as margins from
        clients only by way of pledge in the depository system w.e.f September
        01, 2020. 2 Update your e-mail and phone number with your stock broker
        / depository participant and receive OTP directly from depository on
        your e-mail and/or mobile number to create pledge. 3 Check your
        securities / MF / bonds in the consolidated account statement issued by
        NSDL/CDSL every month. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        "Prevent unauthorised transactions in your
        account. Update your mobile numbers/email IDs with your stock brokers.
        Receive information of your transactions directly from Exchange on your
        mobile/email at the end of the day. Issued in the interest of investors.
        KYC is one time exercise while dealing in securities markets - once KYC
        is done through a SEBI registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund
        etc.), you need not undergo the same process again when you approach
        another intermediary." Dear Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO,
        there is no need to issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number
        and sign the IPO application form to authorize your bank to make payment
        in case of allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain in
        your bank account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have not
        authorized anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone
        claiming to be part of Zerodha and offering such services, please create
